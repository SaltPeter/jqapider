#JQAPIDER
JQAPIDER is a 2d videogame framework written in C-style C++. The aim of the framework is to be used on a small-scale project for rapid prototyping without the need to write up boilerplate code.

Example use cases for JQAPIDER would be in short-term gamejams, hackathons, and contests. A notable example would the Ludum Dare gamejam, which has a timespan of 48 hours for development.
